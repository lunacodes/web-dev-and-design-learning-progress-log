# Notes from Henry Stanley - Becoming a dramatically better programmer

## Learning skills directly

"Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest... The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest."

-[Richard Hamming - You and Your Research](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)

<!-- ## Learning skills directly -->

### Picking skills to work on

* Pick nodes on the knowledge graph that are highly-connected to things you do routinely
    * Can either be highly general (os, vcs, text editor) or more domain-specific (learning a new language)
        * domain-specific learning adds new high-level concepts, which can be applied to other domains

### Picking Skills

* As you learn more skills, create a map of the things you've learned, and the landscape of you things you know exist, but haven't conquered yet
    * These **known unknowns** are extremely important to focus on

#### Identifying known unknowns

* Produce a more complete map of your knowledge graph of a subject
    * Include areas you know exist, but don't know much about
* Try to expand your graph by reading around your known unknowns or by teaming up with an expert

## Learning meta-skills

Meta-skills enable skill acquisition

### Deliberate Practice

* The idea of 'learning styles' is [likely a myth](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/)\*, but finding your best learning methods is always helpful
    * \* Note: I have not read the linked article at present
* Figuring out how best to do [deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice) is also a challenge 
* **Repetition isn't sufficient to learn a new skill**
    * Consider how many people still type with two fingers, despite typing daily for many years

#### Getting better at deliberate practice

* James Clear has an [amazing guide to deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice).
* Broadly speaking, you need to do things that challenge you and get feedback.

### Identifying common mistakes 

* David Cain calls this "[the hole where all the success leaks out](https://www.raptitude.com/2018/05/where-success-leaks/)"
    * "When amateurs [play tennis], they don’t edge each other out by being slightly more skillful. Instead, it’s a contest of who makes the fewest huge, gaping blunders."
* Eliminiating these big, costly rookie blunders, one by one is far more effective than getting quicker, hitting harder, or making that one brilliant shot now and then.

#### Process for identifying common mistakes

* Introspection: if you're honest, you probably already know what the "hole where all the success leaks out" is. Examples:
    * You give up on projects or learning new skills way too quickly
    * You’re routinely sucked in by your phone or social media and lose hours
    * You don’t get enough sleep, and fixing it would make you much more productive
    * You don’t ask for help, and all your projects take much longer as a result

### Deep Work

Deep work is one of the most important skills to learn as a programmer (or any other knowledge worker). 

* Deep work = focused, complex work. 
    * **Learning skills** and **deliberate practice** are both examples of deep work. 
* Shallow work = boring easy, stuff that is required and adds almost no value
    * Replying to emails, checking IMs, scheduling things, etc.
    * These are all straightforward, but not really what you're getting paid to do
* Being able to do deep work seems to be a learnable skill

#### Doing more deep work

* Read the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) (or maybe just the [summary](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/deep-work/))
* Develop a deep work schedule
    * **Recommended Reading:** [Maria ‘Azeria’ Markstedter - The Importance of Deep Work & The 30-Hour Method for Learning a New Skill](https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/)
        * Article recommends dedicating 30 deep work hours (seven four-hour sessions) to a subject at a minimum
            *  It’s too easy to give up after one or two hours before you really know if you like the subject or not
                * The up-front commitment can be very motivating.
        * My notes on the article are [here](link-to-notes)
* Start viewing willpower as a resource that can be depleted, and make sure you aren’t wasting it on trivial things.
    * Switch your phone off, and close distracting communication and social apps 
    * Key takeway from the Azeria article: "As it turns out, we all have approximately 4 hours of willpower available each day."
