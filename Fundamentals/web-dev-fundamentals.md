# Web Dev Fundamentals

* JavaScript: As most responders recommend, JavaScript (ES5 and ES6) is fundamental. TypeScript transpiles to JavaScript. React-JSX-Babel tooling transpiles to JavaScript.
* CSS3: You cannot do serious front-end coding without it. Checkout Flexbox (Using CSS flexible boxes) and PostCSS (postcss/postcss).
* HTML5: It is obvious, but extend your knowledge on concepts like Offline Storage and Device Access (HTML5), best practice starters like https://html5boilerplate.com/.
* Webpack. Modern day packaging, module bundling, build pipeline automation tooling.
* Design Patterns and Object Oriented principles. Composability, Inheritance, Singletons, Pure Functions, Immutability, and many others are core concepts helping you in doing good development in general.
* Algorithms and data structures. Serious development cannot be done without using these in a good measure.

Backend as a Service. Firebase, AWS Lamba, among others.
Microservices and REST/APIs. No modern app is built in isolation these days.
