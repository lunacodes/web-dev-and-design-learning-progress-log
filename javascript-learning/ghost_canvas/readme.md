# Draw a Ghost with Canvas

* The majority of this code is from: https://loopandtouch.wordpress.com/2014/04/22/how-to-draw-a-ghost-in-html5-canvas/
* Modifications I made:
    * Add "use strict" statement
    * Arrow function for addEventListener
    * Canvas Setup and positioning
    * Base helper methods
    * Replace all instances of this.x and this.y with x and y
    * Rename draw_ghost() to drawGhost()
    * add DOCBLOC for drawGhost function
