* [TutorialsPoint - Reactjs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_components.htm)
    * Started on: 5/22
    * Completed through the [Reactjs - Router](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_router.htm) page, then stopped.
        * A decent amount of the earlier pages are useful - but the tutorial uses old or deprecated convetions, and the later code and examples are continually unclear
    The [Reactjs Components](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_components.htm) page was helpful for understanding the details of what `create-react-app` and npm do

**5/23**
* [James K Nelson - Learn Raw React — no JSX, no Flux, no ES6, no Webpack…](http://jamesknelson.com/learn-raw-react-no-jsx-flux-es6-webpack/)
* [GitHub - workshopper - learnyoureact](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyoureact)
    * I completed exercise 1 and then stopped, as the code is 3 years old, and not following modern conventions.

**5/22**
* [Codementor - React Beginner Tutorial: Building a Board Game from Scratch](https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/beginner-tutorial-building-a-game-from-scratch)
    * Very accessible and straightforward tutorial!
    * Key Point: It’s always a good idea to separate application logic from presentation logic, and React encourages this practice. 

**5/16**
