# NPM Snippets

## Global

1. List Global Packages: `npm list -g --depth 0`

Params:
* `list -g`: display a tree of every package found in the user’s folders (without the `-g` option it only shows the current directory’s packages)
* ` --depth 0 / --depth=0`: avoid including every package’s dependencies in the tree view
