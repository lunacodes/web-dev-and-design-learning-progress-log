# Import DB

# Check if your tables are using MyISAM
wp db query "SHOW TABLE STATUS WHERE Engine = 'MyISAM'" --allow-root

# Convert tables from MyISAM to InnoDB
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Author Mike https://guides.wp-bullet.com
# Purpose - Convert MyISAM tables to InnoDB with WP-CLI

# create array of MyISAM tables
WPTABLES=($(wp db query "SHOW TABLE STATUS WHERE Engine = 'MyISAM'" --allow-root --silent --skip-column-names | awk '{ print $1}'))

# loop through array and alter tables
for WPTABLE in ${WPTABLES[@]}

<a id="extending-wp-cli-commands"></a>
## Extending WP-CLI Commands

WP-CLI supports registering any callable class, function, or closure as a command. It reads usage details from the callback's PHPdoc. WP_CLI::add_command() (doc) is used for both internal and third-party command registration.

```php
/**
 * Delete an option from the database.
 *
 * Returns an error if the option didn't exist.
 *
 * ## OPTIONS
 *
 * <key>
 * : Key for the option.
 *
 * ## EXAMPLES
 *
 *     $ wp option delete my_option
 *     Success: Deleted 'my_option' option.
 */
$delete_option_cmd = function( $args ) {
  list( $key ) = $args;

  if ( ! delete_option( $key ) ) {
    WP_CLI::error( "Could not delete '$key' option. Does it exist?" );
  } else {
    WP_CLI::success( "Deleted '$key' option." );
  }
};
WP_CLI::add_command( 'option delete', $delete_option_cmd );
```
